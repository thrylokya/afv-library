# Media Search

Universal routing skill for searching and retrieving existing images and media.

## Scope

**This skill is for FINDING existing media, not CREATING new media.**

**Use this skill when the user wants to:**
- Search for images in Salesforce CMS, Data Cloud, or Unsplash
- Find existing visual assets
- Retrieve media from connected sources
- Browse available images
- Locate specific photos or graphics

**DO NOT use this skill when the user wants to:**
- Generate new images with AI (use image generation tools)
- Create graphics or designs from scratch
- Edit or modify existing images
- Build custom visuals or diagrams

## Before You Search

**CRITICAL: This is a routing skill, not a direct search skill.**

When a user requests to find an image:

**DO NOT call any search tool directly.** You MUST follow this sequence:

1. **First response MUST include:** A list of numbered search source options for the user
2. **Wait for user to reply** with their selected option number
3. **Only then** call the appropriate search tool

**Example of what NOT to do:**
- ❌ Immediately calling `search_electronic_media` or `search_media_cms_channels`
- ❌ Deciding which search source to use without asking
- ❌ Saying "I'll search for you" and then calling a tool

**Example of what TO do:**
- ✅ Show numbered list: "1. Search using Data 360 hybrid search, 2. Search using keywords, 3. Other"
- ✅ Ask: "Which option would you like to use?"
- ✅ Wait for user to reply with their choice
- ✅ Then call the tool they selected

**Your first response when this skill triggers MUST present options and ask the user to choose. No exceptions.**

## Workflow Overview

**The user MUST choose the search source. You CANNOT skip this step.**

1. Identify which search sources (MCP tools) are available
2. **Present ALL available options** to the user as a numbered list
3. **Wait for user to reply** with their selection
4. Execute the selected search method
5. Return results for the user to choose from

If you skip steps 2-3 and call a search tool directly, you are not following this skill correctly.

## Discovering Available Search Sources

**Step 1: Check your available MCP tools**

Look at your environment and identify which of these tools you have:
- Do you have `search_media_cms_channels`? → If YES, include "Search using keywords"
- Do you have `search_electronic_media`? → If YES, include "Search using Data 360 hybrid search"
- Do you have any Unsplash tool? → If YES, include "Unsplash"
- Always include "Other" as the last option

**Step 2: Build your response**

Your first response must follow this structure exactly:

```
I'll help you find that image. Here are your search options:

[NUMBER]. [SEARCH SOURCE NAME] — [Brief description]
[NUMBER]. [SEARCH SOURCE NAME] — [Brief description]
[NUMBER]. Other — Provide your own URL or path

Which option would you like to use?
```

**Step 3: Stop and wait**

After presenting options, STOP. Do not proceed until the user replies with their choice.

### Example First Response

```
I'll help you find that image. Let me check which search sources are available.

Available search sources:
1. Search using Data 360 hybrid search — Semantic search across Salesforce CMS and connected DAMs
2. Search using keywords — Search Salesforce CMS by keywords and taxonomies
3. Other — Provide your own URL or path

Which option would you like to use?
```

If no automated search tools are available:
```
No automated media sources are currently configured. Please provide a direct URL or asset library path.
```

**Example (all sources available):**
```
I can help you find that image. Where would you like to search?

1. **Search using Data 360 hybrid search** — Semantic search across Salesforce CMS and connected DAMs
2. **Search using keywords** — Search Salesforce CMS by keywords and taxonomies
3. **Unsplash** — Free stock photos
4. **Other** — Provide your own URL or path
```

**Example (only keyword search available):**
```
I can help you find that image. Where would you like to search?

1. **Search using keywords** — Search Salesforce CMS by keywords and taxonomies
2. **Other** — Provide your own URL or path
```

**Example (no automated sources):**
```
No automated media sources are currently configured. Please provide:
1. **Direct URL or asset library path**
```

**Wait for the user to select** before proceeding.

## Executing the Selected Search Method

**⚠️ ONLY reach this step if the user has explicitly selected an option from your numbered list.**

If you haven't shown options yet, go back to the "Discovering Available Search Sources" section first.

After the user selects an option, execute the corresponding search method below.

### Search using keywords

**Tool:** `search_media_cms_channels`

**Process:**

1. **Analyze the query** — Understand what the user is searching for (subject, attributes, domain)

2. **Extract keywords** — Concrete nouns that would appear in image metadata
   - Use domain-specific synonyms
   - Maximum 10 terms
   - Examples:
     - "luxury apartments" → apartment, villa, penthouse, residence, condo
     - "company logo" → logo, brand, emblem, corporate logo
     - "bright room" → _(empty if no concrete nouns)_

3. **Extract taxonomies** — Descriptive qualities, styles, moods, categories
   - Only adjectives and attributes
   - Examples:
     - "luxury apartment with river view" → Luxury, Premium, Waterfront, Riverside, Panoramic
     - "bright spacious room" → Bright, Spacious, Open, Airy, Light
     - "car" → _(empty if no descriptive terms)_

4. **Determine locale** — Use format `en_US`, `es_MX`, `fr_FR` (default: `en_US`)

5. **Build the JSON payload** — Construct this exact structure:

```json
{
  "inputs": [{
    "searchKeyword": "keyword1 OR keyword2 OR keyword3",
    "taxonomyExpression": "{\"OR\": [\"Taxonomy1\", \"Taxonomy2\"]}",
    "searchLanguage": "en_US",
    "channelIds": "",
    "channelType": "PublicUnauthenticated",
    "contentTypeFqns": "sfdc_cms__image",
    "pageOffset": 0,
    "searchLimit": 5
  }]
}
```

**Field rules:**
- `searchKeyword`: Join keywords with ` OR ` (space-OR-space). Use empty string if no keywords.
- `taxonomyExpression`: Stringify JSON object `{"OR": ["term1", "term2"]}`. Use `"{}"` if no taxonomies.
- `searchLanguage`: Locale with underscore (e.g., `en_US`)
- `channelIds`: Always empty string
- `channelType`: Always `"PublicUnauthenticated"`
- `contentTypeFqns`: Always `"sfdc_cms__image"`
- `pageOffset`: Start at `0`, increment by `searchLimit` for pagination
- `searchLimit`: Default `5`, adjust if user requests more

**Examples:**

Query: "luxury apartment with river view"
```json
{
  "inputs": [{
    "searchKeyword": "apartment OR villa OR penthouse OR residence",
    "taxonomyExpression": "{\"OR\": [\"Luxury\", \"Premium\", \"Waterfront\", \"Riverside\"]}",
    "searchLanguage": "en_US",
    "channelIds": "",
    "channelType": "PublicUnauthenticated",
    "contentTypeFqns": "sfdc_cms__image",
    "pageOffset": 0,
    "searchLimit": 5
  }]
}
```

Query: "bright spacious room" (no concrete nouns)
```json
{
  "inputs": [{
    "searchKeyword": "",
    "taxonomyExpression": "{\"OR\": [\"Bright\", \"Spacious\", \"Open\", \"Airy\"]}",
    "searchLanguage": "en_US",
    "channelIds": "",
    "channelType": "PublicUnauthenticated",
    "contentTypeFqns": "sfdc_cms__image",
    "pageOffset": 0,
    "searchLimit": 5
  }]
}
```

Query: "car images" (no descriptive terms)
```json
{
  "inputs": [{
    "searchKeyword": "car OR automobile OR vehicle OR auto",
    "taxonomyExpression": "{}",
    "searchLanguage": "en_US",
    "channelIds": "",
    "channelType": "PublicUnauthenticated",
    "contentTypeFqns": "sfdc_cms__image",
    "pageOffset": 0,
    "searchLimit": 5
  }]
}
```

6. **Call the tool** with the exact JSON payload

### Search using Data 360 hybrid search

**Tool:** `search_electronic_media`

**Process:**

1. Use the user's query **as-is** — no keyword extraction or transformation needed
2. Call `search_electronic_media`
3. Pass the query to the tool's search parameter (check the tool's schema for the exact parameter name - likely `query` or `search_query`)

**Example:**
- User query: "modern luxury apartment with natural lighting"
- Tool call: `search_electronic_media(query="modern luxury apartment with natural lighting")`
  (Note: Check the tool's schema - parameter might be `query` or `search_query`)

### Unsplash

**Process:**

1. Extract simple, descriptive keywords from the user's query
2. Call the Unsplash MCP tool with the search query
3. Include photographer attribution in results

### Other (User-Provided URL)

Ask the user to provide:
- Direct URL to the image
- Asset library path
- Specific system/location to check

## Presenting Search Results

Parse the tool response and present **ALL** results as numbered options:

```
I found 4 images. Which one would you like to use?

1. **Luxury Apartment Exterior**
   URL: https://cms.example.com/media/luxury-apt-01.jpg
   Source: Salesforce CMS

2. **Modern High-Rise Building**
   URL: https://cms.example.com/media/highrise-02.jpg
   Source: Salesforce CMS

3. **Waterfront Residence**
   URL: https://cms.example.com/media/waterfront-03.jpg
   Source: Salesforce CMS

4. **Premium Condominium**
   URL: https://cms.example.com/media/condo-04.jpg
   Source: Salesforce CMS
```

**Never auto-select an image.** Always wait for user choice.

## Applying the Selected Image

After the user chooses:

1. **Confirm** the selection with image name and URL
2. **Apply** the URL to the user's code/component
3. **Show** what was changed (file path and line number)
4. **Offer** next steps:
   - Add alt text for accessibility
   - Adjust styling or dimensions
   - Find additional images
   - Optimize image loading

## Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|---|---|
| Tool unavailable | "The [source name] tool is unavailable. Would you like to try a different source?" |
| Tool returns error | Show error message, offer retry with different terms or alternative source |
| No results found | "No results found. Try broader keywords, removing descriptive terms, or a different source." |
| Invalid user selection | Re-display options and ask again |

**Never silently fail.** Always inform the user and offer alternatives.

## Search Behavior Notes

**Search using keywords:**
- Both keyword and taxonomy → results match keyword OR (keyword + taxonomy)
- Empty keyword → search by taxonomy only
- Empty taxonomy → search by keyword only
- Use `pageOffset` for pagination (increment by `searchLimit`)

**Search using Data 360 hybrid search:**
- Handles natural language queries
- Semantic similarity matching
- Searches across multiple connected systems

**Unsplash:**
- Free to use under Unsplash License
- Always include photographer credit
- Note license terms when presenting results

## Key Principles

1. **Always discover sources first** — Never assume a tool exists
2. **Present only available options** — Don't show unavailable sources
3. **Wait for user selection** — Never auto-select a source or image
4. **Show all results** — Let the user choose the best match
5. **Confirm before applying** — Verify the selection before modifying code
6. **Handle errors gracefully** — Provide clear feedback and alternatives
